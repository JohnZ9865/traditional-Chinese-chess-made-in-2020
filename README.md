# traditional-Chinese-chess-made-in-2020
I made this in 2020 with python --- there's plenty of bad programming practices&structuring that I'm aware of and am working to fix --- like putting all of the functionality for each of the chess piece inside the board.play, instead of creating a separate method for each of it in piece. 

But yeah I'm open to new ideas, feel free to contact me about this at szhou110@ucr.edu!
